### Step 4: Create Your Pixel Art

## Pixel Art Tips for Beginners

1. **Start small**: Begin with 32x32 or 64x64 before going larger
2. **Limit colors**: Use 8-16 colors maximum for a cohesive look
3. **Avoid pure black outlines**: Use dark versions of your colors instead
4. **Study existing pixel art**: Look at games like Stardew Valley, Celeste
5. **Zoom out often**: Your art should read well at 100% zoom
6. **Save often**: Save as .aseprite or .psd to preserve layers

## Card Size Quick Reference

| Working Size | Scale Factor | Final Print Size |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| 64 x 48 px   | 16x          | 1024 x 768 px    |
| 128 x 96 px  | 8x           | 1024 x 768 px    |
| 256 x 192 px | 4x           | 1024 x 768 px    |
| 1050 x 750 px| 1x (native)  | 1050 x 750 px    |

For crisp pixels when scaling, always use **Nearest Neighbor** interpolation (not bilinear/bicubic).
